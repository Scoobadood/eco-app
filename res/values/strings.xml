    inmidtown represents the interests of 560 businesses in Holborn, 
    Bloomsbury and St Giles. Our brief as a BID is to enhance the commercial 
    viability of the area and help it realise its full economic potential.  
    We deliver tangible benefits for our members by providing practical, 
    cost-effective services such as recycling and joint procurement. 
    We also aim to add value to the work of Camden Council and Transport 
    for London in the areas of street management, public realm and transport. 
    As well as seeking to influence and encourage local business leaders and 
    key decision makers at the Council and in the Mayorâ€™s Office, we work 
    closely with organisations such as the Midtown Business Club.

    Our aim; the objective of inmidtown is to make Bloomsbury, Holborn and St Giles a quality environment 
	in which to work and live, a vibrant area to visit and a profitable place to do business.
